# Building and Running
Warper uses CMake to generate build files for the Catch-based
unit-tests and Warper command-line program.

```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ cmake --build .
```

The output binary for the command-line program is placed in /build directory and unit-tests are placed in /build/Catch_tests directory.
